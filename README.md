# Chess
## Chess Engine

This application is a chess game, where users have the
option to play against one another. It can be used by 
anyone who wants to play a game of chess, and could also
be used by chess strategists to come up with or test new strategies.

Some additional functionalities include:
- saving the current board
- loading a previously saved board
- a leaderboard

This project is interesting because it needs to deal with a 
large variety of user interactions and check them against the 
movesets of different pieces.
