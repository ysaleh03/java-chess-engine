# Chess
## Chess Engine with AI

This application is a chess game, where users have the
option to play against one another, or the computer. It
can be used by anyone who wants to play a game of chess, 
and could also be used by chess strategists to come up
with or test new strategies.

Some additional functionalities include:
- saving the current board
- loading a previously saved board
- an optional timed mode
- a leaderboard

This project is interesting because it needs to deal with
a large variety of user interactions, check them against
the movesets of different pieces, and also *look ahead* and
*backtrack* to pick its own next move.
